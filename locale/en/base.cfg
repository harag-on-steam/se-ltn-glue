[se-ltn-glue-message]
re-assign-delivery=[SE-LTN] New __1__ arrived through an elevator, notifying LTN about possible delivery re-assignment.
requester-delivery-reset-should-be-disabled=[img=virtual-signal/se-warning] [color=yellow][SE-LTN] The LTN setting "__1__" is enabled. This won't allow trains to return to the surface they originally came from which will slowly drain the surface with less requests of trains and possibly overflow depots on the other.[/color]
